# Minimal, paper-focused requirements for reproducing the IKEA ASM → (segments, XES) export
# and log statistics in this repository.
#
# Tested with Python 3.11 (see README).
#
# Note: Most scripts use only the Python standard library. NumPy is required to read the
# released model outputs / annotations stored as .npy files (e.g., pred.npy, gt_action.npy).
